Description: This package assists with the design and analysis of cross-over
    clinical trials. Precisely, suites of functions are provided to (a)
    identify efficient cross-over designs; (b) determine the sample size
    required by a cross-over trial to achieve a desired level of statistical
    power; (c) simulate cross-over trial data; (d) analyse data acquired from
    cross-over trials; and (e) plot data acquired from a cross-over trial.
    Furthermore, a large number of example datasets are provided to aide the
    exploration of the package's functionality.
